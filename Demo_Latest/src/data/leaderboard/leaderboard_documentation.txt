We didn't want to start from scratch so one of us decided to just design the leaderboard html as a reskin of one of our HW2. We used Boostrap as the main framework for 
styling our webpage. There really isn't much else to say for the html aspect since its very standard for every leaderboard to be formatted as a table. There are 3 
columns: rank, name, and total completion time. Following it are 5 rows indicating the order of the leaderboard with 1st (lowest completion time) being at the top.

As for the Javascript, the basic premise is that the main tag will have an onload property that calls a Javascript function named "displayLeaderbaord()" The function is 
very self explanatory. It gets data from the data base and correctly places them in their proper html id tags. Each row in given an id that follows a basic naming scheme.
For instance, the first row of the first column has the id "first", then "first-name", then "first-total-time". In summary, it just grabs data already in the database, 
then feeds it to the proper html tag indicated by its id.
